# Dimentionality-Reduction-Techniques
There will be so many features in one data set, 
using Dimentionality reduction techniques, we can reduce the number of features in the data set, which actually carry the important information in the dataset.
They are two types of reductionality techniques, 
1. Linear Dimentionality Techniques such as PCA, LDA
2. Non- Linear Dimentionality Techniques such as Kernel PCA, Isomap, LLE(Locally Linear Embedding), Laplacian Eigen, t-SNE
